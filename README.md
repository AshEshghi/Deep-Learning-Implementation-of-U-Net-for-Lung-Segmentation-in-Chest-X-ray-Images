# Deep-Learning-Implementation-of-U-Net-for-Lung-Segmentation-in-Chest-X-ray-Images
This repository implements a U-Net deep learning model for binary lung segmentation on chest X-ray images. The project reproduces a standard medical image segmentation pipeline: preprocessing, training/validation/testing, metric reporting, and qualitative visualization.
